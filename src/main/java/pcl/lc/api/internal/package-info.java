 * We accept absolutely no liability and offer no warranty; the LanteaCraft API is provided on

 * Please do not package the LanteaCraft API in binary form with your distributions. If the
 * LanteaCraft API is changed - which may occur at any time - your binary distribution of the
 * LanteaCraft API can and most likely will conflict with those distributed internally by
 * LanteaCraft.
